**Tools Used**

To try and build out some of the Figma Designs I primarily used the following technologies:

- Expo (React Native)
- React Navigation
- React Native Paper (For easy and clean styling)

**To start the app, run:**

- "npx expo start"

out of the terminal in the root directory of the project

**NOTES**

- For the purposes of speed, I primarily designed and built the 'Onboarding' and 'Login' screens using an iOS simulator. When running the project using Expo, you can also open the app up on the Web, but the images aren't loading properly due to a CORS (Cross Origin) error that I have ran out of time to debug.

- I only attempted the first two screens, as I thought it necessary to set up the proper navigation and themeing solutions, so that if the project is to be continued it has a proper setup to work with.

- I figured React Native was more appropirate than ReactJS considering all the Figma designs were of Mobile app specifications.
